# Let's Make Pr0n!

## Name
 
- Need to come up with a new name you haven't used anywhere else
- Should probably do a quick Google and see whether anyone else is using anything similar in that space

## Gmail (or pick your favorite) address

- Should sign up for this email without any information identifying you directly when you set it up, if at all possible
- Set up 2FA as soon as you set this bitch up

## Onlyfans
- Need to figure out what sorts of things are even supported (filetypes, length, content restrictions, etc)

## Discord Server
- Need to build and lay out the Discord server/roles *before* we invite anyone else
- Make sure the automod bot is working before we go allowing anyone in all William-Nilliam
